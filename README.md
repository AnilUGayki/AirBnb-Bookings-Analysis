# Capstone Project For AirBnb Booking Analysis
## About AirBnb:
- Airbnb's business model is based on connecting people who are looking for short-term accommodation with hosts who have space to rent out.
- Airbnb makes money by charging a service fee from both the host and guest when a reservation is made.
- The company also offers additional services such as Experiences, which allows travelers to book unique activities led by local experts, and Luxe, which provides high-end accommodations in select cities around the world.
- By providing these services, Airbnb has become one of the most successful companies in travel hospitality industry today!

## Business Context:
Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data data that can be analysed and used for:-
  - Security
  - Decisions
  - Understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance the platform
  - Implementation of innovative additional services and much more. 

## Problem Statements:
When it comes to spendings on services, customer will take a deep look inside what are the facilities provided, pricings/budget, customer reviews/ratings, availability, security and location etc. So I tried to list below analysis the customer will take a look at before going to spend on AirBnb Services.
  - Analysis of room types provided by AirBnB. (Which room type is more prefered by customers.)
  - Analysis of locations(neighbourhood_group) prefered by customers.
  - Analysis of average price over room type (What is price distribution based on room type)
  - Analysis of reviews with respect to host_names (Which host_name has more reviews)
  - Analysis of corelation between availability over 365 days, minimum nights paids, price and host count.
  - Analysis of host availability over neighbourhood_groups in percentage.

## How this will be useful for business owners?
  - By Using above findings, business owners can take necessary decisions with respect to the services they are currently providing. 
  - They will able to do required changes as per customer satisfaction in certain areas.
  - They will have details reports generated over period of all above findings which can be useful for their business betterment.
  - They will abe to appreciate/recognise respective hosts based on ratings which may encourage more host to register with AinBnb.
  - They can expand there business in respective neighbourhood and neighbourhood_groups based on number of bookings and nights spends.

This Project, I have tried to cover most specific and required aspects for business analysis.
